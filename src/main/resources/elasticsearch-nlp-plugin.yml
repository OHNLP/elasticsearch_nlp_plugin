  # The NLP components to enable. changes to this setting will require a re-index of all NLP indices or unexpected
  # behavior may occur. Currently supported components are [CLINICAL_STOP_WORDS, CONTEXT]
  #
  # CLINICAL_STOP_WORDS: removes clinical stop words from indexing and scoring
  # CONTEXT: Implements the ConText algorithm by Chapman et al.
  #   which allows for scoring based on negation/subject/temporal/assertion status.
  # EMBEDDINGS: Uses BERT embeddings (Devlin et al., 2018)
  enabled:
    - CLINICAL_STOP_WORDS
    - CONTEXT
